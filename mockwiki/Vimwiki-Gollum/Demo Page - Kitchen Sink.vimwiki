## Anchors
* [ ] TODO: html anchors generally needed for external previewers (i.e. InstantMarkdownPreview for Vim)
* [ ] Gollum handlers

## Code

### Blocks
```
By use of 
three 'backticks'.
```

	Or by indenting 
	4 spaces.

~~~~~
Or use the Kramdown method
~~~~~
```

### Inline
```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```
* example

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

### Syntax Highlighting
* TODO: needs testing - some highlighting for some languages seems less robust than I remember
* Note this is also how we escape backticks (a code fence + 4 space indention
```
	```javascript
	function fancyAlert(arg) {
	  if(arg) {
		$.facebox({div:'#foo'})
	  }
	}
	```
```

* example
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

### DIAGRAMS

#### Sequence diagrams
* Gollum can render sequence diagrams from source on a page. Courtesy of [WebSequenceDiagrams](http://www.websequencediagrams.com/). For example:
* You can replace the blue-modern style with any other supported style. Open the link above to discover what styles are available.
```
{{{{{{ blue-modern
    alice->bob: Test
    bob->alice: Test response
}}}}}}
```
{{{{{{ blue-modern
    alice->bob: Test
    bob->alice: Test response
}}}}}}

#### PlantUML diagrams
* If you install and configure your own PlantUML server, Gollum can render PlantUML diagrams from source on a page. Courtesy of PlantUML. For example:
```
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
```

@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml


You can embed any of the diagram types supported by PlantUML: sequence diagrams, case diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, object diagrams and even wireframe diagrams.

**Notes:**

For wireframe diagrams, you must use the *@startuml* tag followed by the *salt* keyword syntax. The new *@salt* syntax is not supported. See link.
There cannot be empty lines inside the @startuml/@enduml block. PlantUML expects a single paragraph and adding empty lines in between will be read as multiple paragraphs.
If you do not want to use your own PlantUML server, you can configure https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png as the server to use. See here on how to configure which server to use.


## Emojis
* There should be a heart here: :heart:

## Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*

```

* example

	  	* Item 2a
	  	* Item 2b


## Macros
* There aren't many macros as of 07/2017
* Note: In theory these work in subpages as well but that is broken in Gollum v4.1.1

### Default Macros
* AllPages
	*Description: Prints a list of all wiki pages.
	*Syntax: 
```
<<AllPages()>>
```

	*Result (example): 
```
<ul id="pages"><li>AllPagesMacroPage</li></ul>
```
* GlobalTOC
	* Description: Prints a clickable TOC (all pages site wise)
	* Syntax: 
    ```
    <<GlobalTOC()>>
    ``` 
    * you can also override the title: 
    ```
    <<GlobalTOC("All pages")>>
    ```


## Mathematics
* TODO: Unfortunately, Math display is a problem with the pandoc renerer currently used for processing vimwiki files

* To enable mathematical expressions in Gollum, start it with the --mathjax option. Github recommends [this](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) page to learn about the syntax.

### Examples:
* Inline math:
```
\\\(2^2\\\)
```

* Display math:
```
$$2^2$$
\\\[2^2\\\]
```

* By default, Gollum uses the TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML config with the autoload-all extension. You can also set your own mathjax configuration with the --mathjax-config option.

* **Notes:**
    * When using the Org-mode markup, you will have to wrap display math blocks in #+BEGIN_HTML ... #+END_HTML blocks.


## Page Titles (Custom)
* Note that the metadata must be the first piece of text on the page.
* [ ] TODO: document how to escape something like this so it doesn't hose the whole page

    \<!-- --- title: My page title --\>


## Quotes
### Blockquotes
```
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```
* example

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Other Notes
### Uploaded files
* Files uploaded through Gollum are placed in a folder with a space filled name of the page/file.
* i.e. this file's name is 'Demo Page - Kitchen Sink' so an image uploaded via Gollum will be placed under this wiki's directory structure in a folder that is named as it appears below:
```
![GitHub Octocat Logo](Demo-Page---Kitchen-Sink/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png)
```

## Strickthrough
```
~~Struckthrough~~
```
* ~~Struckthrough~~

## Subpages (Footers, Headers and Sidebar)
* Header files are named _Header.ext, where ext is one of the supported formats' extensions.
* Sidebar files are named _Sidebar.ext, where ext is one of the supported formats' extensions.
* Footer files are named _Footer.ext, where ext is one of the supported formats' extensions.
* TODO: there are more references for this

## Tags
* Tags can be finicky. As a best practice it's a good idea to always reference tags from the root of the repository 
* The general rule should be to always favor Gollum links/tags over vimwiki
* (**see #3 in the 'Link Tags' examples**)
* Basic syntax
```
[[tag]]
```

### Escaping Tags: use a single backtick
```
`[[tag]]
```

### Page Tags

#### Include tag (includes a page in the example)
* As opposed to the link tag, this one is dedicated to pages, has a special syntax and includes a page into another, rather than linking it:
```
[[include:cannonical-page-filename]]
```
* Example this will likely mess up the TOC
    * [[include:index]]

### Link Tags
* Basic syntax
```
[[link-text|linked-resource]]
```

* Fully qualified URLs work just fine
```
[[http://example.com]]
[[link-text|http://example.com/pdfs/gollum.pdf]]
```

* Examples
	1. [[index|This tag will result in a different page for vimwiki than Gollum]]
	2. [[../index| This will show the root index for both vimwiki and Gollum]]
	3. [[../PersonalWiki/index| Use relatives paths from root to maintain compatibility -this shows the PersonalWiki index page]]

* Markdown from Examples
```
[[index|This tag will result in a different page for vimwiki than Gollum]]
[[../index| This will show the root index for both vimwiki and Gollum]]
[[../PersonalWiki/index| Use relatives paths from root to maintain compatibility -this shows the PersonalWiki index page]]
```

#### Linking Internal files (not pages or images)
* These can be troublesome between Gollum and Vimwiki.
* Vimwiki will always follow the relative links to files and tack on a '.vimwiki' extension. This means that Vimwiki will try to open new Vimwiki file if followed through Vim.
* Gollum will either show the content if it's an image or provie a tag to follow
* Generally I recommend that if there is a conflict in links/tags between Vimwiki and Gollum that you side with Gollum for content display and binary file handling...
[[Demo-Page---Kitchen-Sink/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png|GitHub Octocat Logo link]]
```
[[Demo-Page---Kitchen-Sink/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png|GitHub Octocat Logo link]]
```

#### Linking internal images
* All of the same issues and querks exist here same as 'Linking Internal files'
* Identical to linking internal files, but also supports several special attributes:
* All of these attributes can be combined together simply by separating them with pipes.
```
[[image-url|alt=text]]
Text to display when the image is not found.

[[image-url|frame]]
Tells Gollum to place the image in an <iframe>.

[[image-url|align=position]]
Tells Gollum to align the image in the given way. Position can be left, center, and right. Default: left.

[[image-url|float]]
Tells Gollum to float the image so that the text flows around it. This option can not be used with the align=center option. When floating is enabled and alignment is not specified, align=left is applied.

[[image-url|height=value]]
Set maximum height for the image. Values must be specified either with px or em unit.

[[image-url|width=value]]
Set maximum width for the image. Values must be specified either with px or em unit.

[[image-url|frame|alt=text]]
Tells Gollum to place the image in an <iframe> and uses the alt's text as its caption.

```

##### Handling image placement issues: 
* By default text will fill up all the space around the image. To control how much should show up use this tag to stop and start a new block so that additional content doesn't fill in.
```
[[_]]
```

#### Linking internal pages

The following tag will create a link to another Gollum page:
```
[[cannonical-page-filename]]
```

* Canonical page filename is the page's filename, but after applying these rules:
	* Extension is tossed away.
	* Spaces (U+0020) are replaced with dashes (U+002D).
	* Forward slashes (U+002F) are replaced with dashes (U+002D).

* Examples:
	* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] will reference the J.-R.-R.-Tolkien.ext page
	* [[Movies / The Hobbit]] will reference the Movies---The-Hobbit.ext page
	* [[モルドール]] will reference the モルドール.ext page

The referenced page may exist anywhere in the git repository. Gollum will search for it and link the first such page that it finds.

## Tables
### Simple
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

### Complex
* [ ] TODO: my plugin is currently broken for the table plugin
* Made simpler with Vimwiki + [dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode plugin](https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode/tree/4e41af8e5f0bf53326d1b83c2feb1eff89fe90d4)
* TODO: Explain how this autoformats for me in vim

| First header | Second header | Third Header |
| ---          | ---           | ---          |
| x            | x             | x            |

## Table-of-contents (TOC) tag
* TODO: note how this needed to be escaped
* Gollum provides a special tag for embedding a table of contents into a page:
\[\[_TOC_\]\]

* Or with a max depth:
\[\[_TOC_|levels = 3\]\]

## Youtube Videos
* TODO: needs testing
* They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:
```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

* Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```
