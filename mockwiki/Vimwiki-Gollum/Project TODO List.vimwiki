# Project TODO List

## Showstopers
* [X] Swap README with QuickSetup
    * [X] rework QuickSetup to be a proper README
* Fix all things marked "TODO" or find a place for it.
  * [ ] i.e. tables in demo page
* [X] document search examples
    * [X] make pages in mockwiki to use for examples

## Release
* [ ] rework extended_readme.md
* [X] Example wiki page content with all the bells and wistles in mockwiki
* [ ] spell check EVERYTHING
* [X] redo mockwiki pages
  * [X] For search examples
  * [X] Some mock content
* [X] Cron(?) script to generate vimwiki diary indexes for Gollum
    * This will probably autogenerate diary indexes for vimwiki also -because large wikis are very slow to index through vimwiki macros.
	* [X] write the script
	* [X] make the cron job
	* [X] document the thing
        * [X] Need to run the script for newly created wikis or wait until cron fires off.
        * [X] if you add a wiki you'll have to run the gen script for the diary to be in Gollum
* [X] Find out if github will follow softlinks with an extension change
    * [X] i.e. move quicksetup and readme into mockwiki/Vimwiki-Gollum as .vimwiki files and link from the root dir as .md files to see of github will serve the pages as markdown.
    * [X] This will let me use sourced files sourced from mockwiki while keeping them in mockwiki for content for the tutorial
    * [X] NOT POSSIBLE
