# Trouble in paradise

Kim is rather upset with me lately because I've spent so much time trying to get this wiki project put together. I've spent an average of 14+ hours per day in the last week just putting this stuff together. I'm not sure what clicked but I finally resolved to trying to find a way to make Gollum work for me rather than just constantly redesigning the entire system (in my head) for a mythical project that would take me a year to build on my own. I'll have to find a way to make it up to her in time. Such is the life of a programmer with an obsession!
