# reconnecting with music

I recently started making a reconnection with my music. I currently have over 2k songs uploaded to google play. Generally speaking, I enjoy programming and working on projects thereof much more with a bit of distraction in the background -whether it's listening to my [favorite radio station on line](http://wbez.org) or watching a mindless bad horror movie, or listening to music outright.

Right now I'm listening to Health:
